\chapter{What are proof and formal logic?}
Well, before to approach about what is proof, in mathematic point of view, we would like to approach a something that is mixed with language and logic.

The reasons to make it is because the proof is made by words, but its are words supported by objective definitions and these definitions are built by words.

I hope that in this first chapter the reader can be able to understand the mechanism that divide between sentences, propositions and expressions.
